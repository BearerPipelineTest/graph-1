# MakeRouteGraph

The Ruby classes and shell scripts located in the `mrg` and `scripts` folders provide the core foundation of the `air-routes` dataset along with methods to create and query the `air-routes` graph in various forms. The air-routes GraphML and CSV files located in the `sample-data` folder are created using these scripts. In the `mrg` folder you will also find  a stand alone Ruby application that can be used to both build and query the air routes dataset. This application is used by the scripts in the `scripts` folder but the core classes can also be used as part of custom built Ruby applications.
